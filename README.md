# 🎬 Netflix Movies & TV Shows EDA

## ❓Problem Statement
"The Netflix dataset provides insights into how content varies across movies and TV shows in terms of ratings, genres, release trends, duration, and global distribution. By analyzing this data, we aim to understand whether TV shows or movies perform better, which genres and countries dominate Netflix’s catalog, how content duration impacts engagement, and how release patterns have evolved over time. This analysis helps uncover viewer preferences, regional content strengths, and strategic gaps that Netflix can leverage to optimize content production, improve recommendations, and expand its global reach."
